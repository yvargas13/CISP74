Project Description: 

We named our project Diegetic. It is aimed to bridge additional services for visually impaired and deaf users who cannot access media in traditional formats. More specifically, films that have not been audio described nor subtitled (for the time being). In addition, we want to keep a track record of these requested films to promote and advocate for the use of high-quality audio description in films where the presentation of visual media is critical to the understanding and appreciation of the content.
