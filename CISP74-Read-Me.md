# What is CISP74 About?
CISP74 is a course taught by Professor Sohair Zaki at Mount San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) under the Computer Information and Database and the Business Department at Mt. SAC. CISP74 is titled "Advance Programming using Python" in which students learn advanced object-oriented programming using Python with topics including: (data structures and algorithms; JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) processing; threads and concurrency; web scraping; web applications; scalable applications on the AWS (Amazon web services) cloud; web services interaction; operating systems interaction; and real-world tasks automation. This course was taught in the Fall Semester 2022. 

# Purpose of CISP74 Respository
This folder is dedicated to the final project of CISP74 to showcase how I and my partner, Julian Arteagea incoporated the topics taught into this course. The final project is creating a CRUD Web Application using Flask and Python

# Project Objective: 
Students must create a web application with the incorporation of a database. Students can use either MySQL or SQLite for the installation of a database as well as Flask, Bootstrap, and other Web Responsive designs and principles. 

# Project specifications and rubric: 

Design: 200 points
- Using bootstrap, HTML, and CSS (50 points)
- Having navigation bars (50 points)
- When designing the web app the pages need to be responsive. (50 points)
- Using appropriate colors, fonts, and styles. (50 points)

Documentation: 250 points
- Web app page mapping. (Site map) (50 points)
- User guide for users on how to use the application. (100 points)
- Commenting your code. (50 points)
- Database ERD diagram. (30 points)(You can use Visio)
- Class diagram (20 points) (You can use Visio)

The project should include the following: (600 points)
- User authentication (100 points)
- User registration   (100 points)
- Must have CRUD (200 points)
- Flask forms with form validation. (100 points)
- Using MVC concepts. Database portion -- Model (100 points)
- Presentation (NOT PowerPoint presentation just going through the project and demoing it and explaining your code to your peers) (100 points)

*NOTE: Deployment was NOT part of the grading the rubirc.

# What is our project?

Our project, Diegetic, is aimed to bridge additional services for visually impaired and deaf users who cannot access media in traditional formats. More specifically, films that have not been audio described nor subtitled (for the time being). In addition, we want to keep a track record of these requested films to promote and advocate for the use of high-quality audio description in films where the presentation of visual media is critical to the understanding and appreciation of the content.

# What did we learn?
In the early stages of the project, we have learned that the Flask library did not respond well to our computers. Despite following the advice of other individuals with the same issue on coding forums and the attempts to fix it, we were unable to use Flask as our main library. This also included the use of MySQL, a compataible library with Flask. With this said, we resolved the matter with Bootstrap and SQLlite.

# What does CISP74 respository include? 
This respository include all CSS, HTML templates, and python files along with class diagrams, relational diagrams, and a user guide as requested for submission of the project. The breakdown of finding such material is the following: 
- Documentation Folder: entails the user guide, Entity Relation Diagram (ERD), a site-map, and a unified modeling Language Class diagram 
- Static Folder: any content that can be delivered to an end user without having to be generated, modified, or processed. In this case, our logo is the only thing that is stored.
- Templates Folder: all HTML material for creating each page on our appliciation.  
- Application.py: our application file
- database.oy: our database file
- movie_respo: the respository for films
